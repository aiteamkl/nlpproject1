Comment,oakland,2,"Apparently, you don't have a problem with the legal dumping because the less cops that we have on the street, the more opportunity for Illegal dumpers. 

If you think cleaning streets is going to stop Illegal jumping, you're more of a dreamer than I thought You were. I live in a part of Oakland where cleanups regularly happen but the dumpers keep coming back.

It's laughable to be blaming the OPD budget for the fact that we don't have alternate means for people who live on the streets. First of all, there are a lot of people ""on the streets"", many of them in RVs, who need to be run out of this town. They are parasites and do what they please simply by giving themselves the title ""unhoused"". How about we prioritize seniors and families.

It also appears that you have little understanding of the administrative backend of police departments. It's not just cops on the street.

Yes, Oakland needs to be more creative with budgeting, but this city is broken. Look at the police commission, a pathetic body if I ever saw one, arguing amongst themselves with not a single member of law-enforcement on the commission. It's a joke!

Ragging on OPD is the biggest problem That Oakland has is a weak argument. 

Do you really think we can attract businesses when we have poor enforcement on the Street? Go ask some of the residence of East Oakland and West Oakland, whether they want less cops or more cops.

Almost every city in California has a problem with Police staffing and now you want to cut compensation for the police chief? Laughable",https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/1jehvxp/please_give_me_your_opinions_on_the_mayor_race/mio27iw/,1742411253.0
Comment,oakland,1,"There's a difference between a lie and an honest error. There is also a difference between people who want to look at a whole person instead of people who are trashing a reputation through guilt by accidental association, as You are attempting to do

You are exactly the kind of ""lefty"" that brought us people like Donald Trump. Looking at your obsession with trying to corral a candidate into an anti-trans position by association, instead of listening to that candidate, and watching the actions he has taken, gives you away. I would put hard cash down on a guest that you were really strong on ""defund the police"", the meme that caused the Democrats to lose one state house after another, and helped to further the cause of the right

Also, by definition, your username, apparently gives you away as someone who is more an anarchist than a leftist. Someone who is reflexively against all Police. Someone who thinks that extra judicial actions are more appropriate than due process. In other words, an anarchist

You are the kind of voter that is going to be more and more denied what you want in Oakland, because the kind of politics you represent doesn't speak to mainstream. It speaks to identity politics; it speaks to the myth that all cops are ""pigs"". It speaks to taking Oakland down a path that it has been going down for years with progressive politicians, for the most part have lost touch with what leftism truly means. A good example of the result of that is what just happened in the last national election, with leftists actually helping to elect Donald Trump  

And there is no changing goal posts here, There is just deconstructing a false argument about a candidate and using that argument to try to destroy the reputation of their candidate. In fact, the lie is yours. If you can prove that the candidate you are against is anti-trans, please do so, but give up the weak argument by association. It's weak, just like the rest of what you have proposed",https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/1jehvxp/please_give_me_your_opinions_on_the_mayor_race/mio0nmw/,1742410800.0
Comment,oakland,2,"The police department uses only about 42% of the general fund. 

And we're not a city of 250,000 people. We are just over 400,000 people so stop playing with the low end of that range. Statistics can lie.

It also looks like you don't understand that people most with a leftist persuasion are not rigidly leftist. Your username tends to give you away.

Your claim that the Colosseum sale was delayed to benefit Taylor is laughable

So far all I have seen from you is statistical games with no substance.

I see a resident who doesn't have a problem with illegal dumping, drug dealing at homeless camps, of failing education system, city, council overreach, and a failed mayor who suffered from recall. No doubt, someone you voted for.

The bottom line is that you are out of touch and almost everything you call for in this thread is not going to happen except for taxes. It remains to be seen how those taxes will be spent to benefit the city.

Last, regardless, your deceptive use of statistics, try effectively policing the city, the geographical size of Oakland with only 35 officers per shift. We need more cops, we need more cops, walking beats, and we need more surveillance technology to help those cops.

I would expect that, if I'm understanding your username correctly, that you think all cops are corrupt, and that maybe ""Luigi"" was right to do what he did. That's the kind of leftism that I deny, because it leads to another kind of fascism",https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/1jehvxp/please_give_me_your_opinions_on_the_mayor_race/minx7jk/,1742409805.0

Comment,politics,27,"Musk is quoted as saying that empathy is a human weakness; Musk seriously does not show empathy, ever - he only fakes it when necessary to make an impression. VMusk is also a narcissist, probably created by fawning parents who thought he could do no wrong. Musk has also admitted that he has Asperger's Syndrome, a form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). \*some\* (not all) persons with Aspergers may experience challenges with empath ( it is important to note that this is not a universal characteristic and there is significant variability among individuals). Surely, this is a problem inherent to Musk's autism (in his case); he just doersn't feel anyone else's pain.

Trump, of course, is a malignant narcissist, with his condition bordering on - or maybe full blown - psychopathy. Trump literally hates people, who only exist to make him feel whole. Narcissistic supply is the ONLY thing that Trump treasures; it's an elixer4 for someone with his condition, with the added feature that people who drop away from his circle or reject him immediately become enemies to get even with (necessary for his condition, to prove to himself that they are ""wrong"" for rejecting him). 

All that said, the rest of the world was shocked when Trump won in 2016; they were horrified and thought it was a one-off. Biden regained trust, but now Trump has won again. For nations that were allied with mutual benefits to America -to have seen those benefits lost and indeed being attacked by America TWICE - is the literal end of the road for trust in America by other nations.

It would also give Trump and his sidekick billionaire Elon Musk full control over government spending, he said, because* ***under a shutdown, the administration gets to determine which functions of the government are essential and which are not. (****emphasis, mine)*

*""In an op-ed in the New York Times yesterday, Schumer noted that Musk has said he was looking forward to a government shutdown. Jake Lahut, Leah Feiger, and Vittoria Elliott reported in Wired on Tuesday that* ***Musk wanted a government shutdown because it would make it easier to get rid of hundreds of thousands of government workers****. During a shutdown, the executive branch determines which workers are essential and which are not, and as Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo highlights, Trump has issued an executive order calling for the government to stabilize at the skeleton crew that a government shutdown would call essential. Yesterday was the government-imposed deadline for agencies to submit plans to slash their budgets with a second wave of mass layoffs, so at least part of a plan is already in place.""*",https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1jbqkw7/protest_chuck_schumer/mhzcq1e/,1742072011.0

However, I don't support vandalizing Tesla's or anyone else's property. Yet, given the degree of division in our nation and the wide-open display of outrageous and publicized fascist behavior of Elon Musk, I can see why some people would be driven by misplaced anger to think they can harm Elon Musk by damaging Tesla vehicles. They aren't hurting Musk; he could lose Tesla and still have a few hundred billion$$

For sure this kind of behavior (which I think is going to continue, sadly) will drive up insurance costs for Tesla owners, some of whom just wanted to buy a car that was environmentally friendly.

What we are seeing is ""American vs. American"", which is EXACTLY the kind of outcome that Putin and Xi (especially) want to see.

I don't have an answer for how to get out of this mess because so much behavior is driven ny carefully constructed and laser targeted via social media and corrupt mainstream media to reinforce hatred on both sides.

Comment,oakland,-27,"You can slander Horn all you want. Yeah, the guy made some mistakes, but did he deserve to have his business BURN TO THE GROUND? Seriously?

His business was directly across the street from a lowlife who manufactured and sold meth from his RV, for YEARS. Horn pleaded with the city to get that guy out of there  - result? ZERO!  All kinds of tweakers were coming and going near Horn's  location in the early morning hours for as long as that RV was there - and his proximity to the drug dealers on Wood St and 34th St didn't help either. ANYONE who opens a business near problems like that should be considered a hero, at least to some degree, even if he made other mistakes.

Matt Horn decried taggers who hit his building; the next day some lowlife burned it so severely that Horn had to close down.  I agree with Horn in his hatred of taggers - so tired of seeing those trash lowlife, low IQ toddler scribblers ruin our neighborhoods with their infantile scribbles.

btw, I know a few former Horn employees who really liked working there. And yes, again, Horn was not the perfect owner and he did have some problems, but did our community deserve to have THIS happen to that building? That was NOT Matt Horn's fault. It was the fault of the scum who tagged and gutted and REGULARLY burned the inside of that structure for more than a YEAR after Matt Horn left.  Even while his business was running, his employees were regularly threatened after hours by lowlife in the area. It's a miracle Horn's place lasted as long as it did in that Wild West corner of West Oakland. btw, where was Carroll Fife when Horn burned down? Didn't hear a peep; didn't hear her calling out the taggers and tweakers who cause this chaos. No, it's better to walk into a minority community and live stream your ""sympathy"" for victims of crime. 

And I'm really sorry to see Kowbird go because the food and service were very good.

It's revealing when someone with an axe to grind comes on here to justify the BURNING and DESTRUCTION of a local building. Get real!

Horn did the smart thing; he moved out of town where he doesn't have to suffer the slinbgs and arrows of asshole taggers; tweakers and violent nutcases who love to burn buildings down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/1j54v6p/what_remains_of_former_brown_sugar_kitchenhorn/mgesbw0/,1741299772.0

Comment,HearingLoss,6,"Suggestions:

1. Look into mindfulness training - nothing better than the Waking Up App and it's a sliding scale (all the way to free, if you are poor) sub. 30 day free trial with no credit card requirement
2. biofeedback sessions - this is what I did many years ago and it began to help me \*relax\* while at the same time hearing the noise inside my head.  In some ways, mindfulness can help in similar ways.

Be aware that your brain will acclimate - you must try to live your life. Notice that when you are really busy or engaged in certain things, you don't notice the noise?  Those times will increase.

Your future is not over.

Another thing to try is Cognitive Behavior Therapy - go get a copy of ""Feeling Good"" by David Burns and read the first 50 pages. This might help you deal with the cognitive distortions brought on by stress.

>""The US can't keep fueling the fires of war through monetary aid or military arsenal. We're not the world police. Either Russia is a credible nuclear, warmongering global threat or they're not. If they are, then the world needs to stop dipping the toes in and out of the water and just jump in and address it.""

 This gives you some idea of how Trump is falling out of favor, even with his own base.

I watched the whole thing on C-SPAN. Looking at Trump's face and demeanor  when he as asked questions like ""What great Presidents would you compare yourself to"" or ""How did you get the courage to take this challenge on"" was revealing. Trump would lighten up - congratulate the interviewer on a ""great question"" and basically reveal the sick narcissist that he is.

Then, after Vance - a weak person if I ever saw one - felt appropriate to start ganging up on Zelensky, thereby enabling Trump's so-far repressed rage during the meeting, Trump let go with a diatribe like I've never seen any POTUS commit in all my years of watching politics.

Comment,oakland,1,"From a friend who lives in that neighborhood:

That building was burned by arsonists after Matt Horn called out taggers and other losers in the area; there was a meth factory in an RV adjacent to the building for at least two YEARS! (they removed it when the city took railroad tracks from the street).

After Horn left, the low IQ scribbler taggers literally defaced the facade of the building that it was for all intents and purposes destroyed.

Next, the who facility was taken over by druggies and indigents who used it as a bathroom. Illegal dumpers filled one end of it with trash.

About a month ago someone started a fire in the whole interior, basically gutting the place.

After that a demolition notice was placed on the side of the building - with demo scheduled after the end of this month.

Comment,HearingAids,1,"I made a mistake. As I recall, the Truhearing audiologist quoted about $1200 for the ""basic"" and roughly $1700 for the ""advanced"" - that's \*per paid\*. The HAs (I think) are Signia VII and IX models, but not sure which generation. Here is what I got this afternoon from a search.

[https://www.truhearing.com/hearing-aids/](https://www.truhearing.com/hearing-aids/)

The audiologist at Truhearing was pushing Phonak during my first visit; they would be thousands more. They carry just about everything, but outside their co-branded HAs the discounts aren't that great.

I hear some good things about the Signia HAs, but also the others.

When I told the audiologist that I spent time on the reddit HA sub she half rolled her eyes and said it was a rabbit hole.

Costco has more choices, and affordable, but thanks to f'ed up insurance they can't activate the tinnitus option - it's absurd.

Anyway, you get 60 days return policy with Truhearing, and you can pay on time. If you don't like them you can try Costco.

[More on the Signia IX ](https://www.hearingaid.org.uk/files/brandsproducts/signia/signia-integrated-xperience/signia-2023-ix-b2c-dl-leaflet.pdf)\- my audiologist said she wasn't sure if the Truhearing HAs were one generation old Signias or not - in any case they are probably pretty good HAs

Your values are fucked.  I know cafe owners who struggle to make rent who have had to spend their hard earned money to paint over the garbage spewed by these loser taggers.

Comment,politics,2,"It sounds quaint, but there are two things happening that have been in the works for a long time.

Extreme conservatives in America - many of them Evangelical Christians and Roman Catholics - have been working feverishly for the last 3-4 decades to chip away at voting rights; LGBTQ rights and at the same time doing everything they can to enable wealthy classes to to dominate in America. Our corporations outsourced many millions of jobs - entire industries and the towns/cities they supported put on life support.

Racism and xenophobia have been with America forever - and often used to blame foreigners and minorities for problems caused by corporate power. 

There are books written about all of this.

Last, and probably most importantly in the recent past is the very clever use of social media hacking by Russia and extreme American conservatives (like Musk on Twitter). 

In 2016 we have factual evidence that Russia used the then-open Facebook platform to target 10's of millions of false ads **by zipcode and even by block** to American voters. Conservative voters lapped up these lies because the lies reinforced their beliefs. There is a LOT of neuroscience evidence about how to hack the brains of humans to reinforce beliefs - true or false.

Putin! I’m not sure if you’ve read or heard about the book Foundations of Geopolitics by Aleksandr Dugin, but it’s basically a political playbook written in the 90s of what and how Russia should do in all parts of the world in order to gain power.  Putin is very close to Dugin and has used his ideas to pursue power and create chaos in America, Europe and even in Africa. Dugin is a far right political philosopher in Russia and apparently Putin utilizes a lot of what is in that book. A weakened West is to Putin's advantage, Here’s a synopsis for the West - Americas:

Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States and Canada to fuel instability and separatism against neoliberal globalist Western hegemony, such as, for instance, provoke “Afro-American racists” to create severe backlash against the rotten political state of affairs in the current present-day system of the United States and Canada. Russia should “introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social, and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.

Then here is the cult of Trump. Americans are pathetically lacking in knowledge about how our government works. We are a consumer society where everything possible has been monetized. We have millions of dumbasses who sit on the couch and eat Cheetos who tune into Fox news and listen to literal propaganda and lies that reinforce their ignorance.

In fact, when Rupert Murdoch started Fox he openly said that his plan was to ""make people angry"" even if it took lies to do that. Murdoch motivated right wingers and ignorant conservatives (many of them, so-called Christians) to vote for literal fascists, racists, LGBTQ haters - and encourage them to blame all their problems on ""liberals""

America has been in slow decline since 1980, when Ronald Reagan called Government ""the enemy"". Reagan was the little fascist that led to the big ones. We have spent TRILLIONS on military adventurism that has led to nothing. We are a failing nation. China is in the ascendency. The BRICS nations are moving forward. Americans at large have not yet experienced real pain, but if what Trump is doing keeps up, we will be far far diminished from what we were. Trump is a literal psychopath - a useful idiot controlled by people who keep him puffed up.

Hope that helps.

Why? Because the fine muscles that control attenuation in your eardrum are not getting sufficient blood supply as that supply is being shunted to large muscle groups, leaving your eardrums (and your hearing) vulnerable. I don't have time to get into the physiology in detail, but understand that your eaardrums have a small series of muscles and tissue that tightens up your eardrum in anticipation pf loud noise (or after initial contact with high SPL).

Where are the SPECIFIC details of Lee's platform? Lee is hoping to slide in under the radar, and I hope that doesn't happen. 

What this feels like to me is a ""coronation"", like when the Dems stupidly coronated Hillary Clinton.

Currently, I am up in the air about who to vote for, but based on what I've heard from Taylor, I'm leaning toward him even though I'm a liberal. 

Lee, recently at a Wellstone Club gathering exhorted her supporters to avoid Ranked Choice on the ballot and ONLY vote for her. WTF? 

Last, no candidate is going to ""fix"" Oakland. We are DEAD BROKE, already having cut bone, and sinew from our city's support services. The Stadium money (if we ever see all of it) will NOT be here to save us next budget cycle. Then what?

 I have no doubt that cops probably have higher levels of domestic abuse, but your claim that cops are responsible for 40% of ALL domestic violence claims is absurd on its face. 

I'm not a cop lover, but what you and a LOT of people don't get is that policing is a VERY stressful land often violent job. Cops are the ones that are supposed to ""fix"" our fucked up society and a percentage of them are abusive. Not ALL of them are abusive - either on the job or at home. Cops are human beings. Look at soldiers coming back from war and take a look at the domestic violence stats there. It's a HUMAN problem, not a cop problem.

The numbers are hard to pin down, but the city spends a LOT of money on this problem, with crappy results. I have personally witnessed - at least 10-12 times over the past few years drug addicts and mentally ill persons refusing help. 

I have been told by people who work with unhoused folks that most don't want to leave the streets.

OP's article at top shows the incredible amount of personal and financial resources to house just ONE person. Enough!

I don't know how we manage to do it, but one thing I do know is that waiting for drug addicts and mentally ill and local voluntary nomad indigents to ""decide"" to take shelter isn't working.

One way or another San Francisco needs to solve this problem. If San Francisco fails, the next mayor and BOS will be FAR more conservative. Then you will see Grants Pass put into action the way the city of Grants Pass acted. I don';t want to see that, but I have had enough of entire neighborhoods ruined by people who have been given ""agency"", when most of the time most of them have no control over themselves. It's a FACT that 60+% of the unhoused population is drug addicted or mentally ill, with another group determined to stay in the streets.

Compulsory treatment will come, and if it doesn't we are going to see FAR more ominous means used to clear the streets. Homeless advocates had better get their act together.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1il3u9f/her_job_is_to_remove_homeless_people_from_sfs/mbwwz3l/,1739139035.0

Comment,sanfrancisco,0,"Those bridge protests in the Bay Area were not blocking weapons deliveries. Don't change the subject - and I will shout and swear if I please, or are you entering a language police phase now?

I'll say it again - ""virtue signaling"", because those protests not only didn't do one damn bit of good for Palestine, but they DID do a lot of good for the jerks who were posting their stupidity all over Instagram. FAFO, idiots.

First, Harris didn't drop any bombs because she wasn't the Commander in Chief. Biden didn't drop any bombs either, Netanyahu did. And if you think that Netanytahu wouldn't have been able to procure weaponry even if Biden stopped shipping it you are even more naive about weapons procurement than you appear.

Your gaslighting Tlaib's purposeful efforts to secure her ""I'm with you"" tropes to her Muslim-American followers worked out VERY well for her. Look at her vote totals.

Racist bias?  Hey how about you look into Dearborn and other largely Muslim-American communities to see how they vote and legislate against LGBTQ, or equal rights for blacks and Latinos.

Your gaslighting the shitshow that is Rashida Tlaib means that you are either a True Believer (read Eric Hoffer) or completely absent any sense of proportion re: this last election. When someone chooses to vote for a -10 candidate over a -4 candidate, somethingi is fucked up in that voter.

Comment,sanfrancisco,-91,"Right. First, they go into an intensive planning stage and buy (or steal) lots of spray paint. Then they use the chops they learned at climbing gym where their Mama bought them a gift certificate to learn how to rappel down a wall alongside elementary school kids on a field trip Then they take a piece of drawing paper with crayons and just like most toddlers (although toddlers have higher IQs than these jerks), they carefully draw block letters to imagine what that block letter will look like on a wall. ""Look"", they tell their low IQ toddler-wanna-be ""artist"" friends, ""it's gone be like this, only BIGGER!""

Once they have gone through a very complex planning stage - just like a 5-year-old would do to finger paint a canvas - they sneak out in the middle of the night or early morning and piss their spray paints all over empty walls - some like to make their block letters really BIG, to compensate for their inferiority. Most people looking at their low IQ scribbles hate these vandals, but in the tagger's eyes, they are spray-painting geniuses because...well...they make BIGGER letters. REALLY BIG LETTERS!  Look Mom! - REALLY BIG Letters!

After they have vandalized private or public property they and their low IQ pals put it all over Instagram, Tiktok, etc. etc. ""LOOK!  Look how cool I am"" - I can draw block letters - really big ones - on other people's property. That makes me an 'artist'. - I'm just so darned cool!""

They really don't seem to care if someone else owns the property that they vandalize of mark up; they think they can do anything they want because they're ""artists"".

Yes, education; good child care; good work opportunities; equal pay yadda yadda will make things better, but until we have those things we cannot just look aside and let people dies in the streets ""wrapped up in their rights"".

For liberals like you (who haven't learned the lessons of the Neoliberal world you helped to create) it's OK to  let people steal from stores unpunished; break into cars; invade homes; die in the streets of drug addiction because they have the ""right"" to refuse treatment (same with mentally ill folks) and just do whatever the fuck they want no matter the negative multipliers of their behavior. That's what the end result of the ""liberal gone wrong"" approach to social problems have led us.

And dude, we ARE the state (for now, assuming Trump doesn't change all that).

For those who claim ""big brother"", you need to know that legislation WITH TEETH that would mandate severe prison sentences for any person in the public or private sphere who abuses public surveillance for private gain or to hurt another person's reputation.

Comment,oakland,6,"I read the Spur report last night. To your point about the Colosseum sale, I kind of agree. Frankly, I don't think Oakland is going to get made whole by the buyers - it's a weird insider deal the like of which Oakland has seen before - e.g. [Look at screw ups for road repairs held up by Fife](https://www.oaklandreport.org/p/the-inequitable-equity-of-oakland) because she wanted to impose her will regarding who got repaving contracts - costing Oakland $6M. btw, Fife isn't alone in this kind of shenanigans.

What I want to understand is the elephant in the rook that nobody is talking about; that's the [$1billion lawsuit by non-local plaintiffs around coal terminal rights](https://nocoalinoakland.info/1b-lawsuit-filed-by-insight-terminal-solutions-against-city-of-oakland/).

I am very worried about this lawsuit because the plaintiffs - some greedy investment firm - have had prior success in the courts over this issue. Even settling that lawsuit for 1/10 of the claim will kill any hopes for recovery.

I am more and more inclined to think that the best way out of Oakland's budget mess is bankruptcy.

We only have THIRTY FIVE OPD officers on street duty pershit and we just cut 25% from the budget even though we lead the nation (or are very close to leading the nation) in certain kinds of crime. We just cut public works - so I guess that means more illegal dumping won't get cleaned up.

People who live in the Flats (East and West Oakland) are TIRED of promises. Thao inherited a colossal mess (sadly, it appears that she might have been corrupt), but she had put a pretty solid security and homeless camp cleanup/illegal dumping cleanup team together within budget constraints? 

Now we are cutting further? Basically, the scattershot from these cuts is going to impact people in the Flat WAY more than the more wealthy parts of town. 

We would still suffer cuts under bankruptcy. That's undeniable, but the current crop of leaders have \*nothing\* to work with - and in fact the poorest parts of Oakland continue to suffer.

Comment,collapse,3,"Well said. Adding to what you've written: 

The speaker in the video quotes 19th century philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer who said: ""life is a constant process of dying"".

It's important to note that Schopenhauer was very interested in and influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism, where, specifically in Buddhism, one of the Four Noble Truths is suffering, the cause of which is [fundamental ignorance or misunderstanding about our own nature and the nature of reality. We suffer because of our mistaken belief that things, including us, are separate, independent, and solid; that ""happiness"" can be permanently; that change can be prevented (it can't).](https://www.lionsroar.com/buddhism/four-noble-truths/#:~:text=2.,as%20samsara%2C%20or%20cyclic%20existence)

Look, a lot is happening right now; change is accelerating and a lot of that change is upsetting. 

I \*think\* that radical acceptance"" means something similar to what Buddhism teaches - it's an acceptance of pain as a mere appearance in consciousness and that we can use out minds to accept the pain and RELAX because the perception of pain (I'm talking about psychic pain here) is always the result of a thought. Thoughts, like everything else, appear to come from nowhere and disappear into nowhere. 

The fact is that radical acceptance doesn't make one passive in the face of injustice, but it helps one to understand that all of humanity suffers this way a(increasing compassion for self and others). It doesn't mean accepting injustice; it means KNOWING that the moments of pain caused by injustice will come and go so that one can avoid IDENTIFYING with a thought and get busy with life. Again, this is not to say that the psychic pain will go away; it means that one can accept that pain (caused by thought); KNOW it is a thought (which comes and goes) and don't let it control your mood. ""Suffering"" is universal, but there are ways to keep oneself from identifying with suffering while at the same time doing what one wishes relative to changing the world.

Mindfulness is one way to practice radical acceptance; there are also other ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1icr462/the_world_is_going_to_hell_and_i_cant_deal_with_it/ma4x366/,1738294420.0

Another thing that bothers me about Lee is her anodyne delivery of the same old political promises that we hear from every politician every time a politician runs.

Lee talks about how we're not going to be able to count on Washington for $$$, so we will have to go to the state. Really? California is projecting budget deficits for the next several years?

I haven't heard Lee (or any other candidate) say that we need SERIOUS upgrades to surveillance technology to supplement the police - nor has she committed to asking for CHP help **long term** to take back our city (especially the Flats - East and West Oakland, respectively) from lawbreakers.

I would rather suffer the slings and arrows  (including cuts) of bankruptcy operated by an **outside administrator** than have a so-called ""recovery"" (which I don't see happening) managed by the very people who caused it in the first place.

Why, for instance, have we been awarding the same percentage salary increases to senior administrators as we have the lower-paid city workers - that's regressive in itself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/1icb0ws/oakland_to_lay_off_hundreds_due_to_budget_deficit/m9pcdk1/,1738097738.0
Comment,oakland,3,"Sales taxes are regressive, yes, but so are cuts to the most basic public safety budgets. Would a poor person want $.50 cheaper (name your everyday item) or better emergency, fire and police services?

How much does the city LOSE, permanently, with these cuts?

How much illegal street dumping not collected? How many dysfunctional, dystopian, needle-spreading homeless camps permitted to remain? How many school kids lacking after-school support will get in trouble? How many senior citizens who count on senior service lifelines languish in loneliness or worse?

And yes, Oakland citizens DESERVE a clean, safe, well-supported with social services city.

Anyone who doesn't think that is either unaffected by these cuts (and preaching from on high), or ignorant of their true impacts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/1icb0ws/oakland_to_lay_off_hundreds_due_to_budget_deficit/m9pa534/,1738097124.0

Comment,oakland,5,"A complete clown show. Why and how on earth can Oakland continue to cut when it has ALREADY cut to the bone?  In fact, I wager that this is a cowardly move to avoid what Oakland SHOULD be doing - namely, declaring bankruptcy.

Instead Oakland citizens are going to have to do with less public safety (fire and police) with many other programs  - like programs to help seniors, cut.

And what plan does Oakland have to get back to balance sheet parity? Answer? None!

The cuts will not achieve budget parity; an increase in sales tax (which I support) will not achieve budget parity. 

What happens next year once the Coliseum money has been spent to support THIS year's budget (assuming the hapless group that the sale was made to comes up with the money they promised to the city).

No detailed plans other than cuts and more cuts. So now we can expect decreases in public safety and other social safety nets that Oakland citizens DESERVE. I am thoroughly disgusted with both the Oakland City Council; the Oakland Administration, and any Mayoral candidate who promises that they will be able to fix this mess.

Denial is all we've been offered for years as Oakland continues to suffer at the hand of incompetence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/1icb0ws/oakland_to_lay_off_hundreds_due_to_budget_deficit/m9p5kn4/,1738095866.0

The most concentrated area of sensitive nerve endings in the vagina is locatednear the vaginal opening, primarily in the outer third of the vaginal canal, which is considered part of the vulva; meaning the highest concentration of sensitivity is found closer to the entrance rather than deep inside the vagina. Key points about vaginal nerve endings:

* **G-spot theory:**Some research suggests a specific area within the anterior vaginal wall (near the middle section) might be particularly sensitive, often referred to as the ""G-spot"".

Comment,Damnthatsinteresting,-13,"Nine Simone was a great talent who suffered from mental illness (bipolar disorder)

An AI overview:

Nina Simone, the legendary singer, pianist, and activist,was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Her mental illness was undiagnosed for more than 20 years, and she struggled with substance abuse as well. Early signs

* Simone's first signs of bipolar disorder appeared in 1967, five years after giving birth to her daughter. 

* She began to have violent outbursts and a reputation for being difficult to work with. 
* She would sometimes refuse to play at concerts until everyone was quiet. 



Diagnosis and treatment

* Simone was prescribed medication, including the anti-psychotic Trilafon, which was sometimes mixed into her food by her friends and caretakers. 

* Her struggles influenced the subject matter of her songs. 



Personal life 

* Simone was married to Andrew Stroud, a police officer who was abusive and controlled her finances and career.
* She faced discrimination in the music industry, with some record labels refusing to sign her because of her race.

Biographers 

* Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan wrote a posthumous biography about Simone, Break Down and Let It All Out, which explored her bipolar and borderline personality disorder symptoms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/1i9apga/nina_simone_recalls_nearly_killing_a_record/m917plj/,1737775290.0

Comment,oakland,1,"I tend to agree with you - to a point, regarding local matters. 

Anyway, I live in a neighborhood that is heavily impacted by tagging. I am very active in my community as a neighborhood organizer and I can tell you that to the person (100's of people, of all ages and backgrounds) that I have addressed about tagging (among other local matters), they all hate it; they are insulted that people come into our neighborhood and mark everything up making it look like a trashy dump.

Taggers have their own sense of aesthetic; I won't argue that. Among taggers, it's a valid aesthetic for **THEM** (read Wittgenstein about ""forms of language), but they completely disregard the impact that their low IQ scribbles (from my and most Oaklander's aesthetic point of view) have on our everyday lives.

Example (one of HUNDREDS). A new business just put in a new fence; they planted flowers at its base; they painted it a very nice light green color to match the surrounding flora. Within TWO DAYS (we're talking 200' of fence) that fence was tagged to smithereens. The owner has tried to paint over the fence three times and the taggers always come back; they don't respect the private or public spaces that THEY DON'T OWN, to express themselves. btw, that particular business owner has made major contributions to our community and painting over that fence has cost him a lot of money.

I can't tell you how many times my neighbors (most of them normally very peaceful people) - both commercial and residential - have expressed wanting to cause bodily harm to those tagger assholes. How would the taggers  like it if someone came over to where they lived and performed an action that defaced something that they valued because they thought it was ""art""?",https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/1i0zdpw/if_you_throw_up_ugly_tags_over_murals_fuck_you/m8y2s4r/,1737740621.0
Comment,OaklandCA,7,"Oakland has a very large black population. Very strategic targeting by the Trump campaign went for black men, and significant inroads were made by Trump with that demographic - also, Latino men.

Here's a good reference

[https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/trump-black-latino-men-working-class-00188185v](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/trump-black-latino-men-working-class-00188185v)

  
btw, much of this micro-targeting was afforded by the massive contributions of Elon Musk - ironic, because Musk is antagonistic to equal rights.

Another source of concern is Russian influence; they have been very effective in helping to divide America from within. Anyone who doubts this effort need only read the works of the Russian Academic  Alexander Dugin, who is called the ""Putin Whisperer""

Here is a quote from right wing political philosopher Aleksandr Dugin from his book ""Foundations of Geopolitics"":

*""Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States and Canada to fuel instability and separatism against neoliberal globalist Western hegemony, such as, for instance, provoke “Afro-American racists” to create severe backlash against the rotten political state of affairs in the current present-day system of the United States and Canada. Russia should “introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social, and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics.""*

Russia has been deploying these concepts actively, around the globe. This should be more widely known; it's not some crazy conspiracy theory.

There is no equivocation on this. It is a brute fact that Tlaib openly REFUSED to endorse Biden or Harris. Do you know why she did that? Because she knew her Muslim base, the ones that she has been lying to a man manipulating for years, would vote for her because she amped up resistance against Biden and Harris. And she succeeded!

Comment,OaklandCA,24,"No one kind of government is going to get Oakland leveled out. Look, Oakland is BROKE; services have been virtually cut to the bone; COVID killed the commercial tax base.

One thing that bothers me about Lee was that she entered the Senate race with zero chance of winning. What made her do that? What was her motivation? I have yet to hear a good reason why she entered that race unless she thought (in a state of delusion) that her Progressive Liberal cred would outweigh the VERY talented and deserving qualities and records of Katie Porter or Adam Schiff..

So she lost and lost big; she was w/o a job and along comes the Oakland gig. What if Thao hadn't been recalled? She would probably have gone off to tun a foundation or something similar.

Comment,EverythingScience,2,"Wittgenstein (who we are still learning from) had this to say:

*""""Other people cannot be said to learn of my sensation only from my behaviour, - for I cannot be said to learn of them.* ***I have them****. The truth is: it makes sense to say about other people that they doubt whether I am in pain; but not to say it about myself."" (PI, 246). This seems to mean that since I cannot doubt that I am in pain, it does not make sense to say that I know I am in pain, I simply have pain or not. So what do you think, can I know I have pain, or does this not make any sense at all?""*  (my emphasis)  (note: ""PI"" in the quote above refers to Wittgenstein's posthumous ""Philosophical Investigations""

The bottom line for LLMs (currently) is that they can learn a lot **about** pain, but are they really (or can they really be) in pain like a human experiences paid.

Caveat: We are evolving LLMs and AI, and will one day begin to scale AI by merging it with genmomics/proteomics; nanotecknology and robotics.

My sense is that one day our species, through the foregoing (and a few other) technologies, spawn new species (perhaps multiple) of human that are in fact capable of ""having pain"" the way we current humans do.

Comment,sanfrancisco,1,"Sit in a few developer meetings were software engineers decide how much legacy code they can use to add this or that or any one of 100 other features without consider considering the goals that the User wants to accomplish.

That has always been the problem. Marketing job is to sell the crap, but the fault lies at engineering.

Edit: actually, the fault lies with senior management who for decades have been pushing product out the door with less and less software quality control. In fact, users are now the testers. It's sad.

Read a book called ""the inmates are running the asylum"" all about how user interface designed failed and new systems have come up to try to combat that problem, but companies are mostly not interested in spending the money so we end up with crap User interfaces

One example: why is it that you have to open a word application or a Mail application instead of just starting to type on your keyboard. It would be trivial to have those applications open up automatically.

Edit to: here is a copy and paste from ChatGPT. The system I was thinking of is called interaction design, by Alan Cooper who is someone I worked with years ago.

Alan Cooper is widely regarded as the father of Visual Basic and a pioneer in interaction design. He is credited with creating the original version of Visual Basic in the early 1990s, a tool that revolutionized software development by allowing non-programmers to build applications with a graphical user interface (GUI).

However, Cooper’s most significant contribution is to the field of interaction design. He is known for introducing the concept of persona-based design, a method for understanding users’ needs and behaviors by creating detailed user personas to guide the design process. His influential book, About Face: The Essentials of User Interface Design, has helped shape modern software design, particularly in creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.

So, while Cooper is associated with the creation of Visual Basic, his legacy in interaction design is what has had a lasting impact on software development practices.

Comment,oakland,5,"I'll give you this - you're in love with flowery adverbs.

The ""emergent expression of culture"" that you're hanging your hat in, in the case of tagging, is a ""culture of disrespect"".

In Oakland's case - tagging isn't ""the effluvia of nature""; it's imposing one's will on the property of those who don't want it there. 

Your wanting to digress back to our earliest so-called ""natural state"" - and somehow equate low IQ scribbles to ""emergent culture"" does little more than elevate this tagging cancer to some special status that deserves attention. 

Incidentally, Rousseau  (the Swiss) was very clear that a return the state of nature once human beings have become civilized is not possible.

So, my good dude, ""everything is relative"" only to the point where someone or another's ""everything"" - in this case, their home, car, building, public space, etc. is violated by some low-dog asshole tagger  who thinks that s/he has a right to place his visual scent (notice the analogy to a dog, marking property) on someone else's territory. That's right dude, \*territory\*. And if you don't think ownership and control of territory is not a propensity and drive that has existed since the earliest of human times, then again, do some research. 

I have spoken with or directly confronted some of these assholes as s they slink out in early morning hours with their vandal toys to mark someone ELSE'S property with with their low IQ scribbles. Taggers are basically anti-social assholes who don't give two fucks about the property they vandalize; they don't give two shits that the small business owners of those properties (many, struggling and financially stressed) have to PAY MONEY to clean up the garbage scribbled spew of these tagging morons.

Do you know how many small commercial enterprises won't open up in a neighborhood that is tagged? HUNDREDS, over years. So what does your ""emergent expression of culture"" do for the people who live there who don't have a supermarket just because the planners for large market chains write off locations they have scouted for opening up a business.

I know a LOT of people in the Oakland flats -- business owners, home owners, apartment dwellers, etc.. I'm in a position to speak with a LOT of them. To the person (and I've asked) they all HATE graffiti and what graffiti makes their respective neighborhoods look like - including the toddler scribbles on freeway signed and support structures.

Taggers are low IQ scribbling assholes because no matter how people plpead with them; no matter how many already-strapped-for-cash business owners have to pay to paint over tagger scribbles, these tagger assholes ALWAYS come back. They don't appear to understand that if a property owner (public or private) covered (painted) over toddler scribbles it means that they DON'T WANT THEM THERE, but that doesn't mean shit to the lowlife assholes who come back and fill that space up again with their garbage markings.

So again, fuck these low IQ toddlers and their infantile scribbles and the anti-social attitude that they bring to community; they are ALL losers who have found the LEAST resistant way to fill themselves up with a kind of perverse power - a power extracted AMONG THEMSELVES - as they create differentiated levels of toddler difficulty in their scribbles and deign to call it ""art"". They are ""proud outsiders"" who in reality have no center - losers who don't have the moxy to get out and CONTRIBUTE to community, and who in their warped sense of ""outsider-ness"" see themselves as self-described heroes. 

Last, whether you (or anyone) likes it, or not - AI-enabled drone fleets are just a few years away in Oakland. They will be aloft 24/7 and watching for property and other types of crime. Networked cameras will be able to follow these assholes all the way back to their Mama's basement or their dilapidated holes in the ground so they can be interdicted the next day by public authorities. I can't wait, nor can my neighbors, who hate these low IQ tagging assholes with a passion that puts the lie to anyone who wants to give value to this tagging dogshit by trying to pretty it up by calling it ""emergent culture"" or even worse, ""art"".

Fuck every tagger in this city who tags anywhere without permission of the property owner - fuck them twice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/1i0zdpw/if_you_throw_up_ugly_tags_over_murals_fuck_you/m7hgh48/,1737049374.0

Comment,sanfrancisco,1,"If your statement is true I'm assuming you work in upper management or for a small/medium sized company. I get layoffs; they happen, but the way companies like Amazon and Facebook (and many others) operate these days is to \*purposely\* state at the outset that every employee will be ranked by his/her senior manager and the lowest performers at the end of the year are gone.

The problem with this is that the variables used to rank people are not often hard number variables - they are soft variables that can result from poor performance in another division or poor strategic decisions made at the top.

Is Zuckerberg a good leader? Was Steve Jobs? Is eff Bezos? I knew people at those companies in high positions and I can tell you that the system of ranking I just described led to suck-up behavior by subordinates and a LOT of in-team backstabbing - i.e. you didn;t want to end up at the bottom 10% ranking at years end. All this led to a lot of dysfunction.

Shareholder values - MOST of it - is largely led by market perceoptions created by CFOs and CEOs. Sure, there are reral market leaders with massive tech leads, like Nvidia (soon to be caught by others) or Apple (when introducing the iPhone or it's object oriented interface in the 80's - people BUY that shit and then everyone else competes to beat them. 

Once you get a leveling out of those events a LOT of companies settle down to mediocrity and micro-management.  Who is FB eliminating - a TON of fact checkers and others on the soft side. FB is LOSING engagement because it has become so anodyne.

Shareholder value for FB is manufactured perception and Zuckerberg knows this. It's all PR spin for him.

So here we are where AI within the next two decades instead of being used to make human work easier, will be largely used to hollow out the job market. The, watch the fuck out, because that will be a perfect soil for autocracies like we can't imagine.

Banksy? Banksy is a conniving self-promoting worm, who produces average art, at best. I don't give a shit that some dumb fucking Oil-magnate sheik is willing to pay $30 million or whatever for his drawings. Also, Banksy arranges his tags with building owners who AGREE to the tags because it helps for notoriety because a lot of dumb shits with too much money have bought his average art.  Tagging w/o permission? Loser.

He will agree to paint and tag buildings. Keith Haring's tags are same as above, but some of his more complex drawings are at least interesting to look at. Anyway, when he was tagging w/o owner's permission? Loser.

Comparing the vandals in Oakland's low IQ scribbles with those people above is like comparing someone who can copy a Matisse painting with Matisse.

Comment,oakland,0,"Are you trying to give everyone on this thread a lesson in ""whataboutism""? If so, bravo!

All your interrogatives at the beginning of your post are just that; you are trying to defuse the claims I'm making ab out tagging.

Also, you are looking at history through YOUR selective lens. My lens is right here, right now; my lens is what I hear my dozens of neighbors who can see the freeway from their homws say about this crap; about how they have to see toddler scribbled letters in uncoordinated colors on fences that they planted flowers under (before the tags were place); they see empty buildings that new businesses won't rent because they have been tagged to oblivion to the point where the owners can't even get insurance BECAUSE of the tags.

Capitalism? Law?  Do you own ANY property?  - car, clothing, house, apartment, etc?  How would you like it if I came over and scribbled or sprayed letters all over your stuff. Or if yuo just painted a wall covered with graffiti that you HAD to pain over (at the cost of $800) as a small businessperson or otherwise be fined by the city because some assholes pissed their ""art"" all over it? 

What don't you get about the fact that people take pride in their hard-earned possessions - even humble ones; or their neighborhoods - even humble ones, and they don't want some low IQ asshole repelling down the freeway they see from their bedroom and having to forever look at his shit toddler drawings every they they open their drapes. 

Graffiti is ""art"" only among the assholes who do it and the REALLY REALLY tiny group of people who are so fucking fringe on the art critic scene nobody knows or even care who they are or what they say.

Graffiti is VERY low IQ crap. I could teach a 4-4 year old to paint 99% of the crap I see on walls, poles, etc and the remaining 1$ I could teach an 8 year old to do - in addition to teaching an 8 year old repelling at a climbing gym; I see it all the time.

I don't know where you got your aesthetic from, and I don't care - all I know is that the people that this shit impacts mostly HATE it and see it as a violation of their property rights.

They slink out in the early morning hours when nobody else is around because they know if they got caught by the owner's of the property that they deface would kick their asses.

Seeing really good mural art defaced by these losers is infuriating.

They make entire block and even entire small neighborhoods look like trash, de-incentivizing small businesses from open up there (there is research to back this up.

Yeah, taggers are losers and they should be found out and have an ankle bracelet put on their animal legs (I'll bet they lift their legs when they pee) and made to clean graffiti every weekend for a year.

Comment,sanfrancisco,1,"I'm glad you got the major thrust of my point. We are already under commercial, universal surveillance, the kind of surveillance that is pushing ads in front of our face every day and letting hackers spam us with their cyber crimes.

It really is not hard to create a system of universal visual surveillance, where cameras and drones are networked to catch a very specific group or groups of people. Those groups can be pre-decided and identified by very good algorithms.

So for example, you have 25 drones flying over east and west Oakland network, looking for patterns of unusual activity at certain hours of the early morning. That's just one of the tasks that could be issued to those drones.

If they see one person or a group of persons walking, stopping, and then painting a wall, they can follow that person back to where they came from. The next day, public authorities can go to that person's home, put an ankle bracelet on him and tell him that For the next 10 weekends, he is going to be cleaning up graffiti and if he doesn't show up he's going to jail for 30 days.

At the same time, if there is a group of people walking at the same time, we're just having fun or running around not bothering anyone. The drones could give two shits about that, because they've been told not to pay attention.

This may sound fantastical to you, but it is very possible within the realm of technology that we have today, and in fact is being used in the various ways in places like China.

We can, I repeat, we can build universal surveillance that has privacy and personal rights protections. It just takes political will.

Network surveillance could spot someone who mug someone on the street at 3 AM in the morning, or who is breaking into property illegally, or who is going 30 miles over the speed limit in a residential zone, etc.

The fact is, that a lot of these criminals, including taggers study the patrol placement of the local cops using their phones. They use their phones to tell each other where the cops are not. They use technology to help them fuck up the visual environment of our city.

Last, study show that many small and even intermediate sized businesses, when scouting locations, will pass over places that are heavily tagged or neighborhoods that are heavily tagged.

And a lot of people in Oakland and San Francisco and other places have come to a place where they just have decided to ""live with it"" because the assholes who walk around with their low IQ and spray cans Think that they have a right to piss on property that they don't own. 

There are parts of my neighborhood that looked really nice years ago that look like trash now for one reason. Tagging.

Huge, random toddler paint filled letters that don't mean shit to anyone who lives here, and you have to look at this shit every day instead of the peaceful visual sense they had before these asshole taggers marked up the sides of buildings, fences and every pole and empty space they could see

I was in target the other day and saw some of the display poles marked with scribbles by these low IQ tags.

There has been some research about what happens to the perception of a neighborhood by businesses who want to come to that neighborhood if there are tags all over the place. It keeps businesses from coming. It makes the place look like it's a home for criminals.

Look, if someone wants to do something with a can of spray paint, they can get a piece of cardboard or buy some lumber or even paint on their own house with their own jacket or their own car or their own driveway, but what the fuck Wright do they think they have to mark up the private property and the public property That millions of people paid for with no contract between those people and these low IQ taggers that they have a right to piss their toddler, scribbles all over our visual environment.

Comment,oakland,-1,"They bought the rights (with permission from owners) to advertise; it's a contract agreed to between the parties. These loser taggers mark up poroperty that does NOT belong to them; they have fucked up my neighborhood big time. Two large businesses put in large border fences with flowers at the base and these assholes sprayed their toddler letters over the entire thing FIVE times, after being painted over. I watched four of them do it at dusk on a dark day - (I was in my car or I would have gotten out and stopped them). They were all well-dressed and painted three HUGE toddler letter signs, obliterating a large section of wall.

  
What those assholes don't understand is that people who live in Oakland hate their shit, really hate it - just ask around. The only people who think it's cool are the low IQ toddler scribblers who slink out undercover of early morning light to mark up private property because they KNOW if the owners caught them they would get their sorry asses beaten.

Taggers are losers.

Comment,sanfrancisco,22,"Well, I'm at it. Here's another thing I would like to have someone look into. How is it that the thousands of mobile RVs, which are essentially mobile shelter and largely occupied by confirmed nomads, allowed to park anywhere they want and use ""homelessness"" as an excuse to mess up our streets at our city?

Everyone of these vehicles should be compelled to register with the city and made to follow laws regarding street cleaning, parking more than 72 hours and one place etc.

Exceptions can be made for people who can prove they are working in San Francisco, But otherwise, why are we allowing this? It's a big part of the homeless problem because what happens in those RVs is completely anonymous and we know what happens to a lot of the waste that these things generate.

Comment,oakland,1,"It was designed as a part of an anonymous structural whole. Ever hear of minimalism? 

Does every piece of structure have to say ""look at me?""

All that these tigers contribute is Visual ""noise"". There is no rhyme or reason to anything they do other than to scribble anonymous letters as large as possible so that they can get street cred with their low IQ tagger cult.

What does it take for a person to understand that if they want to express themselves, that they best do it on something that they own, instead of polluting other people's property with their shit?

I wonder how some of these people would feel if I came along and spray-painted some of their property with things that I think are appealing. 

I totally get mural art. There are some serious artists, painting on flat surfaces and walls that deserve to have their stuff seen, but the stuff that this guy ""fell"" and others like him put up is just pure bullshit, and trash.

Walking through the neighborhood here in Oakland and seeing these lowlife bullshit tags putting their marks up on every pole on every structure on every window, some of them etching their crap with acid on glass Is insulting to the people who live here

Last, I have spoken to several of these people as I've seen them putting things on walls and asked them why they do it. Every single one of them said they do it to ""be noticed"". They said, some of them, that it was ""rebellion"". This is low, IQ, low effort, garbage. 

I can teach a three-year-old to do most of the lettering crap that I see around this city. I can teach a two-year-old to take a spray can and just mark something up randomly like some of these assholes do.

I'm sick and tired of turning a corner and seeing some assholes letters spray paint it all over the place adjacent to 50 other assholes who have done the same thing. This is not art. It's not even ""rebellion"", it's just a bunch of bored, lonely, little losers Trying to get noticed.

A number of cities around the world have begun to deploy drone technology to look for things like this, and the people who do them. I can't wait till that's a reality. These people need to be stopped, interdicted, and made to clean up their crap.

If I want to see scribble, I can go to any preschool institution. I don't want to see it when I'm out in the world just because someone thinks they're crap.

That said, remember that Trump is an unapologetic MALIGNANT NARCISSIST. What does this mean? It means that his ON:LY identity; his very self; comes from adulation (narcissistic supply) from the suckers he has groomed for his ENTIRE life (including his low IQ family members). 

A felony conviction plays heavy with a lot of people, even if they are not bringing it up. Trump knows this and he also knows what personal damage these civil cases have done to what most people powerful people think about him (the ones he REALLY needs for narcissistic supply) really think about him.

My consolation in all this is that this decision is causing Trump a GREAT DEAL of PSYCHIC PAIN.

Trump is now going to strike out even harder against the justice system, because as a malignant narcissist he HATES people, generally and any threat to his supply will be remembered FOREVER. This is the way people like Trump work.

Comment,OaklandCA,26,"Exactly. Lee has almost no executive experience and her large-scale posturing - although something that can work for headlines and leverage in Congress - will NOT work in Oakland.

What I don't get about Lee is that she abandoned her House seat for a run in the Senate, which was almost a delusional move because there was no way that she was going to be competitive in that race; she lost the Senate run - which is something that in her delusional state she thought she could win.

Remember, a Senate seat is 6 years, so she could have floated for all those years just like Feinstein did.

So now Lee's out of a job and is looking for the next ""sure thing"", where she can float for another four years.

Her local platform and statements so far appear as middle-of-the-road boilerplate statements about how she's ""going to bring people together""; increase public safety and blah blah blah.

Where are the specifics? Why isn't she (or hasn't she already) spoken to the intolerable spread of homeless camps into every nook and cranny in the Bottoms (East and West Oakland) and how she is not going to tolerate those camps any longer - how the RVs need to go; how illegal dumpers need to be found and prosecuted;  how lowlife taggers need to be monitored via drones and followed back home where they can be interdicted and forced to clean up their mess and pay substantial fines?

Have we heard anything about how she is going to request LONG TERM CHP supplementation of OPD? How she is going to get the pathetically dysfunctional Police Commission off OPDs back? How she is going to preserve fire safety in the Oakland hills and keep stations open? How she is going to use her network get get SUBSTANTIAL - LONG TERM - infusions of cash from the State and Feds to help bootstrap Oakland to a place where we are solvent again?

I'm not voting for Lee or anyone else who doesn't promise to - and show how they plan to - do these things. and btw, I'm a liberal who has seen Progressive liberalism - which I mostly support - go off the rails with some policies that are self-defeating; virtue-signaling and hurting our city.

What we are beginning to see is many nations creating ""towers of power"" and returning to age-old imperialism - caring for nothing but ""their people"".

Harari points out that people like Trump, Putin, Xi,  Viktor Orban. etc are interested only in territorial expansion and self-enrichment.

We are at a VERY dangerous inflection point as our media has sane-washed these fascist goons to the point where most Americans, even many of those who oppose Trump's maniacal threats, aren't taking them seriously enough.

I only hope we have enough high-level senior officers in our military to counter any of Trump's adventurism.

Comment,sanfrancisco,1,"Ever since Reagan shut down state psychiatric hospitals, a relative pittance has been spent on mental health and drug rehab. I'm quite familiar with the literature and what is striking is that most of the policy around this issue comes from individuals who have graduated from public health institutions and medical schools with a decidedly \*liberal\* framing. 

Incidentally, I'm a liberal, and old enough to remember when we did not see thousands of mentally ill and drug addicted individuals living in filth and cacophony in the streets.

Without getting into my background, suffice to say that cognitive neuroscientists (based initially on the work of Cognitive Linguist George Lakoff at Berkeley) have shown that liberals tend to frame most problems within the context of ""nurturing solves most problems"".  

What we have done is create policies from a primarily liberal cognitive bias that demands that even seriously mentally ill or drug addicted individuals have the same ""rights"" as everyone else relative to personal agency.

I'm here to tell you that this is simply not true.  If you are working in mental health-related environments, there is simply no way that you can believe these people have the ability to make judgements (as a universal principal) when they are sick as well as anyone else,.

I have personally seen dozens of people in my community who are badly drug addicted and/or mentally ill be offered shelter and counseling and other supportive services and turn those services down. (shelter like hotel rooms and community cabins). I've watched hundreds of these people within 2 square miles of where I live create so-called ""self-sufficient"" homeless communities that look, feel smell and operate as dystopian communities worthy of a Mad Max movie and even worse.

Again, I have personally witnessed these things. I have alkso spoken to individuals who were forced into treatment by a judge and \*\*to the person\*\* they say that it changed their lives.

What's missing in all of this is appropriate funding for nurturing services along with compulsory treatment; we simply don't have the person-power to carry this off in ways that work, so we keep returning people to the streets to die ""wrapped up in their rights"".

I will continue to lobby for compulsory treatment in my community and within my larger sphere of influence. We have seen the results of waiting for someone to be ""ready: for treatment have led to.

Last, current studies (with the caveat that there are simple VERY few studies focused on compulsory treatment) show a 40-60% success rate for voluntary treatment; those studies NEGLECT the downstream negative social multipliers caused by people who are not treated and end up in chaos. Those same studies show a roughly 22% success rate for compulsory treatment, but those studies NEVER address the fact that we simply don't have resources to properly address compulsory treatment. The later is what MUST change or we will end up spinning on an ""unmerry-go-round"" of failure where MOST of these individuals end up untreated.

Somehow, everyone gave up when Reagan (one of our worst Presdients) closed our mental institutions. 

Of course, there are larger issues that contribute to these problems, but that is foder for another time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1hvny71/san_francisco_social_worker_shot_in_face/m6377xe/,1736360674.0
Comment,sanfrancisco,1,"There are a dearth of studies that investigate compulsory drug treatment - the last I looked it was about 10-12 studies. Also, the success rate for voluntary treatment is 40-60%, but HOW MANY drug addicts seek voluntary treatment vs. those who don't.

We need to compel treatment and get people off the streets. I'm confident that nurturing programs can be created; it's a matter of societal and political will.

Further, if we DON'T create good compulsory programs, voters are going to run up to the end of their empathy and start jailing drug offenders again. That's something we are beginning to see already.

Comment,politics,3,"Understand that (from a neuroscience point of view) that the algorithms are designed to use your online habit in ways that compel you to keep looking. WE are the product on the Internet; our data is something we give up, for free, to very cleverly designed algorithms meant to keep us engaged.

So, yes, we **are** going to see a shit storm from Trump - expect it. Expect that he will say the most outrageous things because his team KNOWS that kind of rhetoric drives the current conservative base. My consolation is that he really doesn't have a large lead in the House of Representatives, and that the midterms are less than two years away.

Stay sane by concentrating most of your energy on what YOU, personally, can affect. Sure, stay plugged into the national scene, but realize that anger actually provides a dopamine rush; we CAN get hooked on anger.

Keep reminding yourself that all the engagement that the press is now designed to deliver has profit at its ONLY motive.

We are seeing a rightward turn in all developed nations because post-capitalism is causing massive disruption to billions of people. I don't know what the next phase is, but where I think we are going is toward more centralized control. Tech will play a big part in that - not forgetting that we now, for the first time in the history of our species have the power to literally change who we are.

Comment,EverythingScience,6,"This is very interesting research. In Greek mythology, in the Iliad, Odysseus tells his crew members tie him up to the mat of their ship, and under no conditions to let him go until they have passed the island where the Sirens whale with their tempting cries and invitations to come to the island and be intimate with them. The Sirens we're famous we're tempting sailors to come to the island and then killing them. Odysseus knew this.

When the ship passes the island, Odysseus begs his crewmembers to let him go. He tries everything, but they follow his orders, and he becomes the first person to be able to pass by that island and not be killed.

I like how you are whitewahing Muslim-American voting for anti-LGBTQ, or forgetting that those voters, by helping Trump to win are going to cost a lot of AMERICAN lives - including lives in blue states when EPA rules are abolished, etc etc. etc.

I very much consider you a one-note naive voter who has listened to propaganda that was carefully distributed by the GOP on social media - as well as Chinese and Russian propaganda that was specifically targeted to Pro-Palestine voters; Latinos (especially Latino men) and black men.

Anyway, keep whining; it's not going to do you any good, and then maybe learn that ""perfect is the enemy of the good"". Harris was not a perfect candidate, but she was WAY WAY WAY better than Trump for all the things you and even the Muslim-Americans who abandoned Harrris care about.

Last, you conveniently skip over the fact that there have been two wide open offers in the past for a two state solution, both of them turned down by Palestinian leaders.

We forget that a lot of first and second generation Muslim Americans are drawn to authoritarian solutions because they grew up in patriarchal environments. Just look at the anti-LGBTQ laws in Dearborn that were created by and supported by Muslim Americans. 

Look at the Arab Spring as another example. EVERY natino that participated in that dramatic theater ended up **MORE** authoritarian as a result.

Tlaib feeds on that kind of drama and authoritarian energy; she engages in constant, extreme political drama and grand nonsense statements that keep her Muslim base inflamed. It's all about Tlaib \*using\* her base to maintain power. It's all about HER; she's a loose cannon with a big mouth who has been an embarrassment to The Squad and serious liberals ever since she was elected - constantly shooting off her big mouth and letting the rest of the liberal community apologize for her gaffes. Result? She helped Trump become POTUS. So now, her base can kiss Gaza (and maybe Palestine) goodbye because Trump would just as soon vaporize Palestinians as help them. What the hell were people thinking? Answer: they weren't! They were helped by Tlaib and others of her ilk to create doubts about Harris and ACTIVELY work against her election.

Yes, Gaza is a massive tragedy that the US has played a part in, but to ACTIVELY oppose Harris and instead encourage her base to be non-committal (I think 16% of Dearborn Muslims went for Stein) is tantamount to betrayal of her base's desire to save Gaza; to Gaza (and Palestine); and to the American people.

I met a guy on his way out of church and asked if he knew where a good restaurant was and if he knew anyone in town with my last name and he said his father was friends with my grandfather (by name!); I was incredulous. The man (a middle-aged guy) walked us down to a small, inconspicuous restaurant that was about to close (by now it was about 5PM).

Comment,politics,105,"First, Gaza is a tragedy; there's no denying that.

Yet, Dearborn voters and a LOT of first and 2nd generation Muslim American voters are instilled with the drama they experienced when they lived in the Middle East, where politics is little more than theater.

Harris literally said that she would not govern like Biden, but they listened to people like Rashida Tlaib, who I consider a traitor to Muslim Americans; Palestinian-Americans; and, regular Americans. She constantly pushed the ""noncommittal"" meme all the way through the election, even refusing to specifically endorse Harris. Tlaib is an EMBARRASSMENT to ""The Squad""; the Democratic Party and her own people, who are just now discovering that she let penchant for loudmouthed blathering (that Democrats have had to apologize for during her entire term) has helped lead Trump to power.

What now? She will continue to blame everyone but herself for her stupidity, and guess what, her Muslim-American base will support her.

About Middle Eastern political drama and ""own goals"" - just look at the Arab Spring with all if it's drama. What happened. EVERY country involved in that movement ended up with a MORE authoritarian government than the days prior to the Arab Spring phenomenon. We see the same thing from this specific cohort of voters, here.

The authoritarian/conservative penchant of Dearborn Muslim-Americans also shows up in how Dearborn legislated anti-LGBTQ policies.

So now they have Trump and his goons in power, which means Gaza and probably Palestine itself may be vaporized. Maybe they will learn a lesson; the lesson being to NOT trust authoritarian voices, or trust knuckleheads like Rashida TLaib, who is in it for power, only. 

Anyone hearing apologies from Tlaib? Anyone hearing Tlaib saying we need to rethink our strategies? Nope. So there she sits, smirking in the House of Representatives, an embarrassment to the Squad, who are to cowed by political correctness to condemn her words and behavior.",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1hofj4v/leaders_of_uncommitted_and_abandon_harris/m49ewkj/,1735424823.0

Comment,politics,45,"I'm kind of with you on this; the abuse that American workers have taken from their corporate masters via H1B replacement has been almost literally a crime. Imagine a software developer living in Silicon Valley making $175K (which is necessary due to high cost of living) all of a sudden finding out that s/he is going to be replaced by an H1B (sometimes an entire department)) worker making half that, with the H1B living in cheap multi-person housing. To boot, the American worker is often forced to train their replacements as a part of their severance package. This happened probably hundreds or thousands of times. 

Then adding insult to injury, there was legislation passed that let H1B spouses work in America as a perk, which means thousands more Americans put out of work.

I'm NOT saying that H1B workers are bad people; they, too, are victims of the sad, sad economic conditions in India; they just want better lives.

Comment,oakland,10,"The main point of this is that there is dysfunction, literally built into the city chart. For instance, how can a city council member promise to do something for his or her district constituents if they have no power to direct staff?

Imagine this scenario. City Council passes legislation to remove all RVs from the streets of Oakland. City staff drags its heels and very little happens. There is literally nothing that the city council can do, it's all up to the city administrator, and if the mayor isn't on board completely with the city council's ruling, s/he doesn't have to do anything either. 

So what we end up with is city council members who have no power to enforce legislation that has been made to impact their district. Basically the tail is wagging the dog, and until we fix this, Oakland will continue to wallow in dysfunction.

Aside from all that, Oakland absolutely needs supplementary help from the state of California for policing and an infusion of cash from the state to get the city back on track. To date, I don't see a single city council member or potential candidate for mayor asking for these things.

Comment,oakland,1,"Lets say response times go from 4-5 minutes to 7-9 minutes (and more in some districts) - if we are talking about stroke and heart attack victims, it means death or permanent disability. How many homeless camp fires are going to be allowed to spread before they create a firestorm? Already, the MAJORITY of calls for fire emergencies is to homeless camps.

The MOST BASIC responsibility of municipal governance is to protect the health and safety of its citizens. It goes w/o saying that not only has Oakland been failing to fulfill this responsibility in an optimal way, but now we have city administrators and some on City Council voting to make things worse. It's just unbelievable how Oakland citizens have been - over decades - been conditioned to ""settle"" for incompetence and lack of any sense of municipal innovation.

Not a single City Council member or administrator has talked about asking the State for help with policiing (Thao did, but now she's gone, so her replacement should, too - we need DOZENS of CHP officers patrolling our streets). We also need serious supplemental financial help, but I don't know where that is going to come from. New taxes won't balance the budget, so what else is there.

So now we are literally gutting a city that has already been crippled for f\*\*king YEARS. 

What is most tragic about this is that Oakland has every potential ingredient to be a world class city, yet here we are with trash-filled streets; unhoused drug addicts and seriously mentally ill people left to their own devices while they sully entire neighborhoods; etc. 

At this point I see no serious attempt to turn this city around - just a blot of talk and clutching pearls budget cutting. It's pathetic and the people who run this town should hang their heads in shame - and that includes past administrations that helped us get here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/1hhkym4/oakland_fire_browning_out_two_firehouse_for_the/m379191/,1734819851.0

This is something that we, the voters, have let happen. It needs to stop.

In addition, we need to bring more high tech surveillance into Oakland and the Bay Area n general so we can follow these losers back to their lairs and arrest them.

Again, BE KIND to yourself - your life is NOT over. You WILL return to your normal activities eventually, but you need tools to cope with this. Cognitive behavior therapy; biofeedback; mindfulness. Seek out support from friends and family, etc.

You can try anxiety meds and used ONLY as needed - start with a half or quarter dose - the smallest dose. You are conscious of the dangers of addiction, but you can use stuff like that to help you cope, if necessary. At one point I thought I would never enjoy life again; it took a while, but everything was OK eventually, with occasinal flareups that I knew would end. It's like living with a disability. People recover and get on with life and make adjustments.

  
Good luck and big hug!",https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingAids/comments/1hefpz6/does_your_tinnitus_get_bad_when_you_take_your_has/m2cpxcm/,1734368237.0
Comment,HearingAids,1,"Please get yourself to see a doctor or therapist. If you get depressed or suicidal go to an emergency room. I know things seem hopeless now, but your brain will learn to cope. It seems like you need help NOW. Dont put it off",https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingAids/comments/1hefpz6/does_your_tinnitus_get_bad_when_you_take_your_has/m2c890u/,1734362480.0
Comment,HearingAids,1,"It WILL get better. Your brain will adapt to it. Try this: whenever you notice that you are getting upset or anxious by focusing on the T, try deep breathing and relaxing IN THE PRESENCE of the noise. Be aware of the fact that you are not focused on your T every single second; there are times when you don't notice it, even though it's there. 

Two more things:  I highly recommend trying biofeedback and/or mindfulness. One of the leading progenitors of mindfulness in America is Sam Harris. Try his ""Waking up"" app. Incidentally, a few months ago I discovered that Harris has tinnitus - interesting.

[Here is a 30 day free intro to Harris ""Waking Up"" app.](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/guestpass/SCC8DAA0A) Free as in no credit card requirement to try it out and they also have a sliding scale payment system based on ability to pay (even free if you are really poor). Probably the best mindfulness ap pout there IMO.

When I first got T years ago I thought my life was over, but it wasn't. I hung in there. It wasn't easy at times, but eventually my brain adapted - yours will too.  You will have some bad days and some good days. Last, if you find yourself extremely anxious, upset or depressed over this I highly advise seeing a therapist and trying Cognitive Behavior Therapy. 

Good luck and you WILL be OK. I promise.",https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingAids/comments/1hefpz6/does_your_tinnitus_get_bad_when_you_take_your_has/m2abp38/,1734325611.0

Keep in mind that Muslims in Dearborn passed anti LGBTQ laws. Did you hear her say anything about that? She's a piece of shit and the only reason she's in office is because she identifies more Muslim than American. 

 I feel sorry for the people in Dearborn and other Muslims who supported her because now Palestine is going to practically disappear under Trump.

 Already people who voted against Harris by voting for Stein or Kennedy or Trump are regretting their decision because they see what is starting to happen in Israel and Palestine. The bottom line is that Tlaib activated her base when Biden was showing cognitive decline, and then refused to endorse Harris, even though she said ""I support the Democratic ticket"". Again, she specifically, I repeat, specifically refused to endorse Harris. She's an embarrassment and a virtual traitor to not only United States, but to the Palestinians that she fake ""represents"".  By the way, I'm a person who hates Trump almost more than most of the people I know, and have a lot of respect for the squad, butTlaib is a cancer in the Democratic Party Who cost us votes. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1hct6vi/trump_makes_horrid_confession_on_plans_for_israel/m1w0o7h/,1734111374.0

Baloney!  It's been CLEARLY shown that Hunter Biden's penalties were ALREADY excessive for his minor crimes. Thousands of people screw up on their CC license apps and people who pay back back taxes with penalties (as Hunter did) usually don't receive any penalty at all. A very good plea bargain that would have included penalties higher than the norm was nixed by the GOP and powers-that-be.

And, pigs like Patel (if confirmed) were sure to hound Hunter for another four years or more - for what?

You know what? Fuck that. And we have a LITERAL felon who has gotten away with multiple crimes and pardoned multiple felons as POTUS - and you are putting Biden in that same basket? You are either naive in the extreme or ignorant of what just happened during this last election.

Housing for all?  Americans think a house is mostly in the burbs with a lawn; that's what most developers want to build - either that or market-rate condos.  Where is the money for that?

I think this is the linchpin election for the American public to learn about what fascism is, although it's not going to be fascism like under Hitler or Mussolini, but a kind of ""fascism light"".

There are still blue states in this country and they will resist. There are blue regions within the red states and they will resist. Resist! Stop blaming and pointing fingers and get off the couch and make sure that you fight fascism in your community.

The one thing that hard times show is who has character and who doesn't. We can point fingers, or we can get off our ass and do what we can to keep these thugs from having their way with us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1h46ydo/trump_and_his_team_are_laughing_at_bidens/lzwylw5/,1733080825.0

Comment,politics,1,"There was a very good poll a while back that indicated the major reason the majority of people vote for Trump is to punish liberals ('own the Libs"").

In the world of cognitive neuroscience, pretty good research shows that if a group of people can be made afraid, and if that fear can be (whether real or perceived) directed at someone(s) to blame, that the fearful group will cooperate to punish the threat **even if there is a personal cost to the fearful group.** 

This is exactly what we see with Trump and so many other authoritarians. Really, it's a perception game, and the GOP have been working this angle for a LONG time, to the point where they (a true minority) have been able to motivate people to vote and behave in ways that is counter to their interest.

Facebook hacking by Rusians was a BIG reason that Hillary lost in 2016; there were also other contributing factors (she was not a great candidate), but the razor thin margins can be chalked up to Russia manipulating the FB platform and spewing 10's of millions of messages to people who were on the fence or undecided.

Comment,politics,1,"Can the Feds cut state funding unilaterally, all at once? NO

Some federal legislation has provisions for withholding portions of funding under certain circumstances. For example some funds for highways can be withheld if a state has a drinking age under 21.

Normally this authority will be delegated to the Secretary of the Department administering those funds, for example Highway Funds - Secretary of Transportation, Health Funding, Secretary of Health and Human Services, etc. And there are always criteria included in the law as to why funds can be withheld and limitations on how much can be withheld.

There is no way or provision to withhold all federal funds from a state. It is not the President who decides. States can challenge such withheld funds in court.

I'm a liberal who watched nutcase, upper-middle-class , clueless spoiled brats actually carry pro-Hamas signs on campus and block bridges - for what?  For their instagram feed or some self-satisfied, uninformed idea that they were going to teach Kamala a lesson? Those dopes committed an own-goal  and actually HELPED TO ELECT DONALD TRUMP. Also, give up the ""weirdo"" trope - you're too lazy to make up anything original. You don't have the cajones to use the words of a true liberal hero, Tim Walz.

YOU and your absurd kind are the ones who forgot about the working class, who, instead of simply working your ass off to make sure we had LGBTQ rights insisted that we had to have pronoun boxes before our names. How do you think middle America related to that?

I work liberal causes like crazy, but I'm sick of the little, ahistorical punks who have poisoned the Democratic party with their cultural identity bullshit.

And yes, one of the reasons Kamala lost was because she's a woman, or don't you read post-election polling?

Losers like Rashida Tlaib, at a time when we knew Trump was in resurgence, actually told her ignorant Muslim base in Dearborn and other places not to support Biden, and then on top of that refused to endorse Kamala.  RASHID and people like her are the weirdos. It's ultra-progressives like you who supported that shit. Death at the polls by a thousand cuts.

Last, a lot of those Muslims come from Arab nations who have not even been willing to accept Palestinian refugees, what does that say about you and your ahistorical support for them?

I expect that you are pretty young and have very little knowledge of how Palestinian and Arab leaders sabotaged one peace agreement after another in years past that would have led to a two-state solution.

What has happened in Gaza is beyond the pale, but you and your kind have been led down a path of thinking it's a simple thing to stop Israel. I don't have time to give you a history lesson.

The sheer amount of stuff they left behind in the street (visible in the dumpster) was incredible; they probably stole the fireworks.

I heard someone say that OPD arrested some people, but no reports from OPD so that is probably not accurate.

My solution: as soon as someone steals something from a retail establishment, they are detained and have an ankle bracelet put on right on the spot. They are directed to go home. The following week they are scheduled for public service works like street cleaning during their time off from work or if they're not working, full-time.

Comment,OaklandCA,18,"Oakland needs to face the reality of financial insolvency. There  is simply no way that we can cut budgets to make up the difference. 2-3 dozen OPD officers (maybe more) are going to retire and the city is thinking of cutting OPD overtime even though OPD has been short-staffed BEFORE any consideration to cut overtime? The criminals will have a blast with this news - we only have 35 officers per shift now, what will that take us down to?

Fire safety? Talk to any one of the station fire captains in the Bottoms. The majority of their calls are for homeless camp fires. So we're just going to let those burn?

Illegal dumping? The city wants to cut public works and reduce illegal dumping cleanup? Unreal. Pengweather (a public citizen hero who voluntarily cleans illegal dumps) has practically begged the city not to cut public works.

Where are the staff for cleaning up the homeless mess. We have literally hundreds of RVs ILLEGALLY parked on our streets, dumping their human waste down storm drains; blocking street cleaning; dominating entire neighborhoods with drug dealers and prostitution in their midst. Those people are NOT ""unhoused""; they have shelter, but they need to move OUT of Oakland. Enough of coddling voluntary nomads who don't accept alternate shelter. If they don't want to move out, tow them.

Schools. Enrollment is down and we MUST close of somehow shrink physical plant.

Insolvency was successfully used by Detroit and some other cities. I'm tired of oCC members telling us that they will ""solve the budget problem"" when it's impossible to do without seriously compromising an already serious quality of life situation in Oakland. 

We should be a world class city. Instead, we futz around with half-solutions that put us deeper in the quality if life hole.

Comment,oakland,19,"There has been a ""hands off"" policy relative to letting campers have a choice about whether or not to accept alternate shelter. Many won't; that has to stop. Some will say it's inhumane to insist they take shelter because they can't take their belongings with them; or that there are rules in the shelter that they won't abide. Some have pets. Some need a  fix every several hours. It's a complex problem. 

Nevertheless, this has to stop. First, we need to make it very clear to people living in RVs who DO have shelter, that they either accept alternate shelter or have their RV towed (with a 3-day notice). Second, we need to free up jail space for seriously mentally ill people and NOT mix them with the general population. We need to provide some support services to those folks; the same for drug addicts. 

We need to arrest and incarcerate drug dealers in the camps. Sorry, if you are distributing fentanyl, you are helping to murder people. 

None of this is perfect, but the camps must stop. We need to invent solutions as we go instead of waiting for a perfect infrastructure to house people on the street, where they die, become more addicted and mentally ill and become a general nuisance to surrounding community.

Comment,politics,1,"The ""real stats""? BS  Tlaib had influence even beyond her district because a LOT of people - especially young people (look at liberal college campuses) were (as they shuold have been) enraged about Palestine. It was HUGE news when she called for her voters and others who listen to her to go ""uncommitted"". When that happened early on I knew - based on watching her over years - that she would continue to push it. Look at the stats in Dearborn and other districts with heavy Arab/Muslim populations. Again,  Tlaib helped Trump to win. She's a piece of shit; a Hamas sympathizer and from some of her rallies comes off also as an anti-Semite. 

Caveat: even if other factors weigh in on this loss, it's is undeniable that Tlaib influenced her voters to vote AGAINST Harris, thereby giving Trump advantage. How STUPID does someone have to be? In essence, she voted FOR genocide. What a fucking irony.

Just watch; this is only the beginning of her vilification. People who watched her trash Harris and Biden have long memories.

My hope is that future Dem Congresses write her out of power and consideration, Put her in the back row where she belongs.

Her entire career in the Congress has been one big mouthed gaffe or proclamation after another that Dems have has to apologize for or rationalize to her base.

Comment,HearingAids,1,"Yes. That is loud. It's very important that you try to get into what I suggested, above. Hard as it might seem, if you can work on relaxing when conscious of the sound, the psychological stress will \*eventually\* diminish. There will be times when you are trying to relax (via biofeedback, mindfulness or whatever (prayer, taking a walk, etc.) and you become aware of your relaxation and lack of panic and then suddenly become aware of the sound \*bothering\* you. Immediately go back to relaxation technique. If you can be conscious of the sound and not be bothered by it even for one second, you can eventually cope with it.

I'm not an expert, but have gone through a similar hell. My tinnitus is not as loud as yours, but I am super sensitive to any audio intrusions, so it was hell for me. Sometimes I relapse into a panic, but go back to realizing I can control my mind.

Also, have you seen an ear specialist?

Comment,politics,110,"It's coming from their old cultures, which are authoritarian - cultures where corruption is taken for granted and wide open.  Their politics are way more ""drama-driven"" than our are (if you can believe it). They have heard strong men all their lives. Men are dominant in their culture; women are second-class citizens and sometimes property.

Look at the Arab Spring? Remember that? Remember how the Liberal West cheered it on? Remember the month's long drama in the streets?  How did that turn out?  EVERY SINGLE NATION that participated in Arab Spring ended up with a MORE autocratic government than before - and in Syria's case the complete disintegration of that nation by the very autocrat who ruled it (Assad) who remains in power.

Latin American and African (and even Southeast Asian cultures like India) immigrants also come from mostly male-driven, paternalistic, authoritarian cultures.

I'm not saying that all immigrants from the above regions are captive to authoritarian appeals, but the bulk of them are - including many of the women. A lot has been written about the time bomb waiting for the Dems once Latinos begin to gain some economic hegemony, Latino men are conservative, mostly.

So, combine all of the above with AI-driven targeting on social media, where a majority of the above folks (including us, especially GenZ) get their information, and you end up with the result we saw on Tuesday.

This race is not about policy - you can't beat well-targeted propaganda and cultural propensities with policy promised; you have to meet them on the same turf.

Gaza is now finished, period. Just one day after the election, Netenyahu said that Palestinians were not going to be able to resettle in Gaza. So how did all those protest votes work out.

What gets me (an an emotional level, in spite of my comments above) is that most of these immigrants are here because of Democrat Party policy; if it wasn't for the Dems, many of them would be back home suffering. It's maddening to hear that they felt betrayed by Kamala, but based on what I wrote above, understandable.

These people are going to learn a horrible lesson under Trump and especially under the pure fascists who advise, write, and make-up Trump's administration. NONE of this is due to Trump's smarts; he's smart only as a conniving malignant narcissist. Trump is an evil useful idiot for the evil people behind him.

This is going to get worse, with one caveat. Trump is a useful Russian idiot, and so may be Musk (who's not as clever as he thinks he is); they and others lust only for power - not democracy.

Comment,sanfrancisco,35,"Prop 7 was IGNORED by the California Legislature; they purposely buried it to play favor with PG&E and some others, like a bogus group called ""Save Standard Time"" that presented biased research to legislators. I followed the Proposition and the legislation (AB7) closely; it was buried first by Prop 7 \*author\*, Kansen Chu - (he authored Assembly bill 807, which led to Prop 7), claiming (AFTER the Prop passed woth near 60-40 margin) that he ""wanted to hear from ALL of his consittuents before he pushed AB7 for consideration. Chu is now termed out (thank goodness - his office and he were useless)

Finally, it went to the Senate Committee on Energy, Utilities and Communications which was at the time headed by someone who was working \*against\* the bill.

At the time, Washington State, Orgegon and the northern region of Baja California had ALL agreed to go to permanent DST (no change, just DST all year) IF California passed the bill and it received approval in Washington (which it would have). Instead, the Legislature buried it again and only recently has AB7 been resurrected.

Imagine a Proposition passing 60-40 and being ignored by your legislature (btw, I vote Democrat, and was grossly disappointed by the duplcity I heard from staffers and Legislators alike)

Last, we have NOT had permanent DST for any seriously long period of time, so it really has NOT been studied properly.

Comment,Jazz,-1,"Yeah, art is subjective. Frankly, a lot of what I hear in a lot of the jazz examples you mention is ""noise'.  That's just me.  I'm not taking anything away from the great drummers mentioned here. In fact, we're both making broad statements that result from subjective taste. For instance, I think cymbals is overused by most drummers - not the hi-hat, single cymbals. they don't contribute much IMO. 

As for playing odd time signatures, agreed, they can be broken down and learned by a skilled drummer, but back to Morello - Morello's drumming IMO was more \*tasteful\* than some of the drummers you mentioned. Like Haynes, who was a giant, and some of the others, when I hear their fills they may result from different combinations and permutations of basic rudiments, but they don't complement the \*melody\* of a tune the way Morello's do. 

If course, you are free to disagree. And again, Morello isn't ""the best"", he's ""my"" best. I prefer him over the others. Like for some Steve Gadd isn't their cup of tea, but I will defend Gadd's drumming (in general) serving the wide variety of music he played with his own groups and (mostly) as a studio musician over just about anyone else. btw, Gadd was Corea's favorite drummer.

Last, I don't see Elvin Jones, Haynes or any of the drummer you mention being able to (in the case of Brubeck's odd-meter tunes - beging able to \*complement\* those tunes tha way Morello did.

Very last, Morello and Buddy Rich, who you claim to be more likely to be lauded by non-musicians and casual fans is litttle more than hearsay.

Comment,EverythingScience,1,"Yes. I saw something about this about a year ago.

Comment,Jazz,-8,"Technically, few drummers have ever reached the technical skill level of Morello. Combine that with his innate ability to SERVE the music instead of dominating the music- much like Stave Gadd does in other genres (and jazz when he was at the top of his game).

I don't think that any of the drummers mentioned, save Cobham, would have been able to deliver on the odd time signatures a la Brubeck that Morello did.

Comment,politics,2,"it's not at all inaccurate to represent Muslim voters for Trump as a potential ""savior"" of Palestine (even if only a 1% chance) as delusional, and somewhat representative of the chaotic conditions that those voters experienced under the mostly autocratic regimes they emigrated away from. ""Drama"" is what tends to rule in Middle East politics. Example: look at the Arab Spring - a massive movement that was drama-filled to the max. What was the result? \*Every single nation\* that went through the Arab Srping ended up the SAME of MORE autocratic than prior to Arab Spring. 

It's a (cognitive science - see George Lakoff) - principle that people who are reared in certain environments (liberal or conservative) maintain a cognitive filter toward politics (and life, in general) that is difficult to breach or modulate.

For instance, we know that highly religious people tend to be more authoritarian - that's Evangelical Christians; many Muslims, many Hindus, etc. 

Sadly, if losing the Muslim vote wins Trump the Presidency, Palestine will end up being reduced to literal dust - wiped out and gone forever, Then, what will those Muslim voters do?

I blame a large portion of this on Rashida Tlaib, who I consider a borderline traitor to America and even to Palestine; she has been a loose cannon ever since she entered the House. I'm also disappointed (as  a Progressive LIveral) at the other members of the Squad who have failed to speak out against he refusal to endorse Harris. Tlaib needs to be primaried; she is not an American patriot; she appears to care more about the tragedy in Palestine than the tragedy that would befall America if Trump is reelected.",https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1gi48f2/why_many_arab_voters_in_michigan_are_flocking_to/lv2gcia/,1730577147.0

Comment,OaklandCA,33,"Toddler art. I caught a guy on San Pablo plastering stickers all over every pole he passed; the stickers had more toddler art drawings. I stopped and asked him what he was doing and he said doing what he was doing was a way for the ""system"" to pay attention to him. I told him he was marking up other people's property and he appeared surprised at that revelation. I asked him whether he would like it if I came to where he lived and spray painted or put stickers all over his house. He said ""I wouldn't mind"". I retorted with the fact that if he really wanted to get noticed he could get a group of taggers together to clean up their tags. He looked amazed at the idea - apparently ""attention"" was the key trigger for that guy.

Last week I caught three taggers on Mandela in West Oakland and told them that our neighborhood was sick and tired of their marking up our buildings and if they got caught tagging by some of my neighbors that it would not turn out well for them if they got caught because people were (and they really are!) pissed off and outraged by tagging. They looked at me with a straight face and walked away.

Frankly, I think we need seriously severe (not jail) penalties for these people. Put an ankle bracelet on them as soon as they are caught and put them to work cleaning up tags for 30 days. If they don't show up - 30 days in jail. They are vandals and destroying property that isn't theirs.

Comment,sanfrancisco,0,"Drones are not single purpose; they can be directed and trained  (via self-learning algorithms) to detect all kinds of urban crime - e.g. reckless driving; street crime; dogs of leash; illegal dumping; tagging; car theft;  illegal car parting; etc. etc. This isn't going to happen tomorrow, but we are approaching a time within the next decade when technology will be a crucial and necessary supplement to law enforcement. What I'm saying it that the days of these loser taggers and their toddler ""art"" is definitely going to come to an end.

And if you think drone tech in these situations is unproven, perhaps you should visit Shanghai or perhaps try speeding on rural roads in the UK and see what happens.

Very last, I will reiterate my feeling about taggers - a feeling shared by several business owners I know and many of my neighbors: they are worthless, toddler scum with ragingly low IQs who think they are "":cool"" for spraying or marking their toddler ""art"" on other people's property. Seriously, these people are just plain selfish jerks. I wonder how they would feel if I marked up their homes or cars with a 5$ can of spray paint.

Here, you have an opportunity to begin to assert your \*right\* to take care of your body/mind.

I call BS on that. If you have an RV you are housed; if your RV doesn't obey ALL traffic and parking laws, you get cited and/or towed.

Also, if there is detritus and garbage, stoves, bicycles strewn about or adjacent to an RV that is blocking a sidewalk; bike lane, etc etc., kiss it goodbye.  No more hoarding!

Comment,videos,2,"Humans have exhibited tribal and warlike behaviors throughout history, but these traits are not the entirety of human nature. Tribalism, or the tendency to form strong in-groups based on shared identity or affiliation, is rooted in evolutionary survival strategies. Early human groups depended on cooperation within their tribe to hunt, gather, and protect each other, often leading to conflicts with other groups over resources. This in-group vs. out-group dynamic is thought to be a fundamental aspect of human psychology.

However, humans are also capable of empathy, cooperation, and complex social behaviors that promote peace and collaboration. Societies have developed moral and ethical frameworks, laws, diplomacy, and cultural practices aimed at reducing violence and fostering harmony. While war and conflict are part of human history, so too are efforts at conflict resolution, peacemaking, and cooperation on a global scale.

In essence, humans can be tribal and warlike under certain conditions, but they are equally capable of creating peaceful, cooperative societies.

That said, any claim that humans do not have a propensity to wxclude the ""other"" fails within the historical record. Sure, we can be peCeful and cooperative, but underlying Those traits are wired drives for status, tribal, hegemony, and acquisition",https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1fe81jb/cynthia_weils_911_footage/ln42faf/,1726334613.0

Comment,videos,1,"Another wrong assumption - i.e. that evolutionary psychology is non-falsifiable. I'll wait for you to deny that our species is tribal and warlike.  Humans also have cooperative propensities, but even those propensities are wired toward cooperation of exclusion toward the other.  Also waiting for you to show me the science on how humans are primarily peace-loving animals - free of the near-universal traits of exclusive tribalism; status seeking, and accumulation. 

What's stunning to me about your argument is your implied claim that all prejudices ""just happen, just because xyz, with no causal substrate. in biology.  Maybe yuo shuold none up on some of [Robert Sapolosky's work.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrRndtcPTQ4) Your claim is that I'm denying environmental influences. Not so. I'm simply pointing out that humans have an evolutionary history and the current science looking at that history is pretty clear about our human propensity to exclude those who are unlike us. 

Also, we know from a lot of really good physical and social anthropological work that our ancestors were tribal. Implicit bias is wired into human behavior. Of course, the social milieu one develops in has a role in activating how ""the other"" is defined, but the propensity is always there.

And Jordan Peterson is generally full of shit and I could care less whether he agrees with me, or not. If he agrees, then good for him; he's further ahead than you are.

Comment,videos,1,"Your understanding of evolutionary biology is naive. I don't care if you took a course or two. 

And, of COURSE our current cultural milieu impacts our behavior, but what you're missing are implicit biases that are baked in from the past. Human brains (well, parts of our brains) are neuro-plastic - i.e we can learn to control behaviors and even modify strong behavioral propensities.

Like I said, you need to bone up on cognitive neurosceince (start with Lisa Feldman Barrett's work - it's accessible and she's a Nobel-quality researcher.

I get what you're saying because I've heard spew like yours many times before. Sure, if we change cultural conditions people change - duh. But we CANNOT erase the trace of behaviors that literally made us who we are.

btw, that is all going to change now that we have the tools to alter our species; they're primitive now, but they are developing at exponential speed.

All that said, you come off as passionate in your position. It's too bad that your assumptions are all wrong. You need to ask the right questions. You're too wedded to being ""right"" instead of approaching with an open, exploratory mind. Mostly, I see you delivering a quasi-intellectual word salad. And Jordan Peterson?  LOL!  Man, talk about the pot calling the kettle black?!?  You are totally PROJECTING a Jordan Peterson vibe. Listen to yourself.

Another thing you might do is read  Thomas Kuhn's classic ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions"" and while you're at it you should also read the late Richard Graeber's ""Debt: The First 5000 Years"" [https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/special/statesofdamage/syllabus201516/graeber-debt\_the\_first\_5000\_years.pdf](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/special/statesofdamage/syllabus201516/graeber-debt_the_first_5000_years.pdf) 

Graber's book was an instant ""classic"" a tour de force.

Very last, I kind of feel sorry for you, because your dogma is closed and not open to inquiry (rad Karl Pepper on this issue).  Your opinion (and that's just what it is, because it flies in the face of very, very good research) has hardened around your own biases. I have experienced the likes of you when I encountered the Continental school years ago - people like Derrida, Saussure, Foucault, Deleuze, etc.);; they were on to something, but they lost themselves in complex word salads that fizzled out. Foucault was the only one who made lasting contributions.

And now, I really need to go, unless you whet my appetite with a serious post - one that shows you really understand evolutionary biology instead of infecting it with your own bias. Right now, you are your own worst enemy. Cheers",https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1fe81jb/cynthia_weils_911_footage/lmyk2v8/,1726248661.0
Comment,sanfrancisco,20,"When someone is an active \*imminent\* threat against the public or police officer. That said, the word ""imminent"" is very, very subjective.

For instance, I have seen police training videos where someone wielding a knife was able to make contact with a cop from 22' away before the cop could unholster his weapon.

Also, we have to take into consideration the latest research ((see [Lisa Feldmen Barrett)](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lisa+feldman+barrett%2C+law+and+justice) in the world of cognitive neuroscience on what emotion is and how our brains literally use the memory of past events to create action or behavior in real time. 

One could write a book about this stuff (some have). Understand that a cop in the field is seeing things in a week that you or I won't see in a lifetime. It's an incredibly difficult and dangerous job. One of the reasons we need to be VERY careful with public safety hires is that ""past events"" for some people means a deep racist background or other problems that are going to dramatically impact the way they act on the job. 

Last, just think about what it must be like when a cop does something as basic as make a traffic stop. Does the driver have a gun? Is the driver a psychopath? Is the driver just having a bad day or simply not paying attention? What happens if I'm injured, who will take care of my family etc etc.

Comment,videos,0,"Man, you REALLY need to bone up on evolutionary biology. Our early ancestors traveled in small nomadic groups of roughly 100-150 individuals; they very VERY territorial - cooperating among themselves (even overcoming internal conflicts) to exclude outsiders. The groups that were most successful at this propagated far more successfully than those that did not. **We have their genes**

If you take some time, you'll learn that the implicit biases that we all carry around re: ""the other"" are always just under the surface. This is the practical cause of most of our tribal behavior, which has since evolved from the savanna to our modern condition.

Also, cooperation toward inter-and intra-social development is what ""causes"" what you and I call civilization.

Lots of research in this area, including imaging research.

That platform couldn't exist and wouldn't exist unless lies and misinformation were not only allowed, but by allowing them, implying that lies and disinformation are acceptable.

Taking your position just a bit farther (and not even to the extreme), you are living in a world where there would be no intervening authority to help people determine what is true or for the greater good.

For instance, to lie and create conspiracy theories about vaccines has led to many deaths, and will continue to lead to more deaths. We know this from epidemiology studies. So lets say that the ""vaccine is harmful"" meme takes strong hold in the conservative community. What happen? More conservatives die.

What gets me is that you are not really encouraging freedom; you are encouraging untruths that not only threaten freedom, but lives.

Last, the ignorance you spout (ignorance is correctable, but stupidity isn't) is stunning to me because if you take your position to the extreme you completely eliminate social trust.

Comment,sanfrancisco,1,"I don't associate you with the worst tradeoffs/drawbacks. Rather, it's an attempt to show you that baked into the human psyche is a \*wired\* need for social organization. I spent a good part of my life in the world of cognitive science and learning, with a more than fair understanding of how social organizations and brains work. 

Also, we're far from your original point; you appear to have moved the goalposts from your claim that minorities should somehow achieve some special status via our society ""letting minorities try some things out to see how they work"". That's not going to happen any time soon, if ever. 

""Minorities"" try all kinds of things; evolution itself is an example of literally trillions of minority efforts to adapt to a given environment - some, in novel ways. Sometimes a novel variable unlocks an adaptive advantage. 

Going from the aforementioned microscopic example to 30,000 feet, where societies interact and adapt, we find all kinds of social experiments happening all the time. Anarchy, cooperatives, religious variations, etc, etc. 

One thing to remember; we all live amongst others who are driven by \*wired\* impulses for status as well as rejection of the 'other"" (implicit bias). Again, these are wired behaviors; we have learned (well, some societies have) that we need to control some of those propensities for the greater good.  

The extreme conservative minority in America has almost always taken to rejection of diversity (necessary for social sustainability) and outright violence to get its way. If you read history you will discover this is a fact.

Current and past rule by minority in America, enabled by structural flaws like the electoral college has let us to a place where slavery and Jim Crow were allowed to persist for hundreds of years.

The majority and this nation want better gun control, better healthcare, equal opportunities for men and women, the right for women to choose what they want to do with their own bodies, but the minority doesn't want to hear any of it.

You keep talking about the minority, but when you look at the numbers and what people in America actually want and then run that up against how the minority in this country has kept the majority from getting what it wants. And, and doing so the minority has caused itself to suffer even more. What does that lead to?

Are you aware that the average Californian through federal transfer taxes pays $10,000 a year to keep roads, hospitals, schools, and other basics of infrastructure operating in states like Kentucky, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Missouri, etc. are you aware of that? 

The fact is, if you look at the places that you call ""the rest of us"", they are saddled with the worst healthcare systems, the worst schools, the poorest economies, etc., etc. The worst educations, etc. they are filled with the politicians who do everything they can to create barriers to the vote. Compared to other nations are voting system is atrocious. With fascists and some of these red states in the rural areas, I didn't even some of their cities doing everything they can to keep people from voting. Imagine that! it's bullshit. And then, to actually pick up and follow like a cult a piece of human garbage and shit like Donald Trump. And most of those folks are calling themselves Christians! They would know Jesus if he slapped them in the face. 

The rest of us? Look, we are supposed to be.ONE Nation, not a bunch of little nations Where are the most uneducated and poorest and most racist people are supposed to have the rule of law on their side, but at the same time, enjoy the fruits of what the more successful regions produce

Comment,sanfrancisco,1,"I have read the federalist papers and yes, it is a ""feature"". Like a frog born with two heads means the frog has as a ""feature"" of his composition, two heads.

They did the best they could, and much of our original constitution is a great document, but there were many structural flaws.

You can pass this all you want, but in the generic America thinks of itself is a democracy and a leading light of democracy and that is the way we have promoted ourselves the last 150 years at least.

Comment,videos,-25,"The drum playing was dumb, stupid and an insult to jazz drumming. Too many people think ""play fast = great solo"". Just dumb. As a drummer I hated this movie and also the very unrealistic portrayal of an abusive drum teacher; he wouldn't have lasted one week in an elite program.

Object lesson: really GOOD jazz drummers can play very fast of they want to, but most LISTEN to their fellow musicians and blend. Good drummers are TASTEFUL; they serve the music. Just playing basic rudiments fast on a drum set is OK, but it's BASIC stuff. A lot of pop drummers who get all kinds of plaudits suck so bad it isn't even funny; they pound on the drums and cymbals and make noise to a beat that a kindergartner could make.

What is most important for these lawbreakers to be reminded of - with serious fines and some jail time if they repeat - is that driving any kind of vehicle on California roads is a PRIVILEGE that can be maintained ONLY by following the LEGAL rules of the CA DMV.

To have the opportunity to learn from them is a privilege, even as we disagree on whether Trump is fit to guide the nation.""*

This writer is deluded; he may hate going to Trump rallies, but these Evangelical fake Christians are just as batshit cray-cray as what he sees at the rallies. Oh, sure, they may patiently ""explain"" their position, but all they are doing is parroting the lies that their cult pastor or some other loser has told them. Most of them are ignorant of the fact that Jesus never talked about abortion and that abortion is permitted in the Old Testament and a woman's life is shown to be worth more than the life of the fetus in the Old Testament.

You can point this out over and over to these so-called ""Christians"", but they always squirm out of it by quoting some out-of-context Bible phrase. These people are the ones who make women suffer and vote for losers like Trump from their middle-class comfort; they are anti-science; they are APOSTATES who would condemn Jesus because Jesus' teachings are unequivocally LIBERAL

Only a literal cult member or someone very unstable would believe the garbage Trump and these fake Christian pastors spew and sadly there are tens-of-millions of ""Christian"" suckers who believe this stuff. And btw, these believers are not all just ""suckers""; many of them are downright haters who use religion as their crutch.

Note to the author: the ONLY thing you learn from these people is that their ""religion"" is used for nothing more or less than a cover for their simmering hatreds and biases - now available for public display because their BS pastors and fake-Christian political leaders gave them permission to do so.

Comment,sanfrancisco,1,"Enough of these dirt bike dirt bags!! They have been terrorizing neighborhoods for **years** - riding up onto sidewalks en masse; driving \*directly\* into the path of oncoming cars in some stupid game of chicken; running lights; blatantly doing whatever the hell they want with ZERO consequences. 

I asked a cop on Embarcadero a few years ago why SFPD wasn't going after those losers and he said that SFPD was under orders not to pursue. I was stunned by that answer. 

When are we going to deploy a fleet of drones in this city that runs 24/7 and can track these losers back to where they came from. 

How is it that when one of these guys is on the road next to a police car and the police will not immediately stop them for no license plate?",https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1ez54t1/assault_on_valencia/ljkccg3/,1724428947.0
Comment,sanfrancisco,0,"What policy? Policies require money. Where's the money? No way we can build our way out of this. 

I'm at a point where is someone is in a working RV, THAT is their home. They have NO right to settle where they want to in the city.

We should be prioritizing homeless seniors and families with kids. 

Next: compulsory confinement (with treatment( for drug addicts and the mentally ill.

Drug dealers in the camps? Immediate arrest with no bail.

Stolen car choppers in the camps? Immediate arrest with no bail

If shelter is offered and refused? You get a ticket out of town. If you show up again (and you;re not mentally ill or a drug addict), you go to jail.

RV on the sidewalk? You get 24 hour4s to move it. If yuo don't move it, it gets towed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1ewznh0/has_anyone_elses_neighborhood_gotten_much_worse/ljhcp5e/,1724378984.0

Comment,sanfrancisco,0,Disagree. Breaking up the camps breaks up the rhythm of illegal activity that happens within them.

Comment,sanfrancisco,7,"The protestors need to be charged and penalized to the FULLEST extent of the law. Let their punishment set an example and be a warning for ANYONE who blocks a major public thoroughfare, putting thousands of people in danger (that includes the criminal sideshow jerks).  For instance, what if a car fire started on the GG Bridge during a protest, and spread? What happens if an ambulance from Marin needed to get over the GG in an emergency? What happens if a pregnant woman's water breaks or someone has a stroke or other medical emergency.

Comment,sanfrancisco,8,"Breed's strategy is that she will continue to disrupt the camps until those in them who are offered shelter take the shelter, or leave. This is a good plan because we see what happens when these camps get out of control - dystopian gatherings where chaos and anarchy rule.

And with Farrell you see what I have been predicting will happen for years. Eventually, people run out of empathy. In San Francisco, regarding homelessness,[ we have caused a ""Tragedy of the Commons""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). Result, San Franciscans feel threatened and they are reacting by turning ""right"".

A lot of this is the fault of well-meaning but misguided ""homeless advocates' who have been advising unhoused people NOT to take shelter. Or, fighting for the right of self-described ""nomads"" who refuse to live in a standard domicile to live anywhere they damn well please. That's over and it's about time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1ewznh0/has_anyone_elses_neighborhood_gotten_much_worse/lj5i587/,1724209820.0
